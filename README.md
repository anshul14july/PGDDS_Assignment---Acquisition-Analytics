To predict the probability of a response from each prospect and target the ones most likely to respond to the next telemarketing campaign. The steps were as follows:  Identify relevant predictor variables for a response using EDA.  Build predictive models and choose the best one.  Sort the prospects in order of decreasing probability of response (predicted by the best model) and target the top X% (or top Y deciles), where X would be determined by your business objective (e.g., maximising the overall response rate/number of responders at a fixed marketing cost).
